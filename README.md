# Simple Landing Page (React + Tailwind CSS)

A responsive marketing/agency style landing page built with React 19 and Tailwind CSS 3. Includes a hero banner, services highlight, about section, FAQ accordion, and footer — structured as accessible, composable components.

</div>

## ✨ Features

- Responsive layout (mobile‑first) using Tailwind utility classes.
- Hero banner with marketing headline and CTA.
- Services section with media + content layout.
- About Us section (component scaffold present).
- FAQ accordion with accessible toggle buttons (ARIA attributes, keyboard friendly state).
- Reusable Card / Element component primitives (see `src/components`).
- Semantic HTML + basic accessibility considerations (landmarks, aria-labels, roles, focus states preserved via native elements).
- Clean component folder structure for easy extension.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React 19
- Create React App (react-scripts 5)
- Tailwind CSS 3 + PostCSS + Autoprefixer
- Optional animation utilities: `tailwindcss-animate`
- Testing libraries: `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`

## 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Node.js >= 16 (CRA 5 is compatible; 18+ recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node) or Yarn (optional)

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```powershell
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Hot reloading is enabled.

Create a production build:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Run tests (watch mode):

```powershell
npm test
```

Optionally eject (NOT recommended unless you need full config control):

```powershell
npm run eject
```

## 🧩 Customization

- Tailwind theme: edit `tailwind.config.js` (extend colors, spacing, fonts).
- Global styles: `src/index.css` & `src/App.css`.
- Add new sections: create a component in `src/components/sections` and import it in `App.js`.
- Images: drop into `src/assets/images` and import with relative path.

## ♿ Accessibility Notes

- FAQ uses buttons with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for screen reader clarity.
- Sections use semantic elements (`section`, `header`, `footer`) and roles where extra clarity is helpful.
- Ensure new interactive elements remain reachable (native elements or add proper keyboard handlers).

## 🔍 Potential Improvements / Roadmap

- Navigation bar active link highlighting + smooth scroll.
- Expand FAQ answers with real content & add animation.
- Dark mode toggle via Tailwind class strategy.
- Add SEO metadata (Open Graph, meta description) in `public/index.html`.
- Convert repeated button styles into a shared component.
- Add unit tests for the FAQ toggle logic.

## ✅ Testing Strategy (Suggested)

Basic examples you can add in `src/__tests__/`:
- Render Hero and assert CTA button is present.
- FAQ expand/collapse toggles `aria-expanded` state.

## 🧪 Scripts Summary

| Script | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `npm start` | Run dev server (port 3000) |
| `npm test` | Jest watch mode via react-scripts |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `build/` |
| `npm run eject` | Copy config locally (irreversible) |

## 📦 Deployment

After `npm run build`, deploy contents of `build/` to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3 + CloudFront, etc.).

## 🙋 FAQ (Project)

Q: Why React instead of plain HTML/CSS?  
A: Componentization & future scalability (adding logic, state, integration tests) while keeping DX high.

Q: Can I swap Tailwind for another CSS framework?  
A: Yes—remove Tailwind deps, update PostCSS pipeline, and replace utility classes with your framework or custom CSS modules.
