## üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Node.js >= 16 (CRA 5 is compatible; 18+ recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node) or Yarn (optional)

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```powershell
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Hot reloading is enabled.

Create a production build:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Run tests (watch mode):

```powershell
npm test
```

Optionally eject (NOT recommended unless you need full config control):

```powershell
npm run eject
```

## üß© Customization

- Tailwind theme: edit `tailwind.config.js` (extend colors, spacing, fonts).
- Global styles: `src/index.css` & `src/App.css`.
- Add new sections: create a component in `src/components/sections` and import it in `App.js`.
- Images: drop into `src/assets/images` and import with relative path.

## ‚ôø Accessibility Notes

- FAQ uses buttons with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for screen reader clarity.
- Sections use semantic elements (`section`, `header`, `footer`) and roles where extra clarity is helpful.
- Ensure new interactive elements remain reachable (native elements or add proper keyboard handlers).

## üîç Potential Improvements / Roadmap

- Navigation bar active link highlighting + smooth scroll.
- Expand FAQ answers with real content & add animation.
- Dark mode toggle via Tailwind class strategy.
- Add SEO metadata (Open Graph, meta description) in `public/index.html`.
- Convert repeated button styles into a shared component.
- Add unit tests for the FAQ toggle logic.

## ‚úÖ Testing Strategy (Suggested)

Basic examples you can add in `src/__tests__/`:
- Render Hero and assert CTA button is present.
- FAQ expand/collapse toggles `aria-expanded` state.

## üß™ Scripts Summary

| Script | Purpose |

| `npm test` | Jest watch mode via react-scripts |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `build/` |
| `npm run eject` | Copy config locally (irreversible) |
